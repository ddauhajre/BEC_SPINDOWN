 	 BEC Spindown Example Case

UCLA Sept 2023

------------------------------------------------

This example case sets up a doubly periodic, flat bottom domain
and constitutes a 1-D (in z) BEC (bgc) spindown problem. 

It can be run
locally on a small grid. For testing/code development, it can be useful to still partition into subdomains and use different LLm, MMm (see param.opt) for testing purposes 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					SETUP DESCRIPTION

The ROMS initial condition comprises const. temperature with no flow. 
The physics is not forced and no ROMS variables should change from their 
initial condition (which are all 0 apart from T,S)

The BEC initial condition prescribes an analytical shape function (in z) to all BEC nutrients.
The user prescribes the min/max of this nutrient profiles and there is a paramter (gamma) that sets
whether the nutrient profile is a minimum (gamma=1) or maximum (gamma=-1) at the surface and vice versa at the bottom. This recipe is defined below

All plankton tracers are set to 1e-6 in the surface layer to provide some small seed to initiate growth.

The bgc is forced by `turning on the light' in BEC (without the real radiative forcing on the physics) with a constant PAR and constant dust, iron, and atmospheric pCO2.  These are set in bgc.opt (at the top) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			  	SPECIFIC CPPS CREATED FOR THIS SETUP 
				i.e., these are not standard in the ROMS repo

ANA_BEC_INI --> for initializing tracer min/max in tracers.F, tracers.opt
ANA_BEC_FRC --> for setting constant dust, iron, and pco2air
ANA_PAR     --> for setting constant swrad0 (which is converted to PAR) 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				INITIAL CONDITION RECIPE
See ana_init.h for the code

-----------------------
ROMS initial conditions
------------------------
        --> u,v,ubar,vbar,zeta=0
	--> right now, the temp is initialized to a const (15 degC)
	---> you can change this recipe in ana_init.h
	
----------------------
BGC Initial conditions
---------------------
The BEC tracers are initialized as:

trc(z) = t_min + (t_max - t_min) * F(z)
where
F(z) = 0.5 * (1 + gamma * tan(alpha * (z + h_sbl)))

This basically sets a transition in the surface layer (z>-h_sbl) for t_min or t_max to
t_max or t_min

If gamma=1, this prescribes a min at the surface
If gamma=-1, this prescribes the max at the surface

t_min, t_max, and gamma are all set in tracers.opt as:
t_anamin
t_anamax
t_anagamma 
** The presently coded values for min/max are taken from eyeballing SoCal ROMS-BEC solns ** 

h_sbl is set in ana_init.h

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				WHAT TO EDIT TO CHANGE THE SETUP

- bgc.opt    --> sets constant bgc forcing (swrad0, dust0,iron0,pco20)
- ana_grid.h --> grid setup (grid dimensions, f, depth)
- ana_init.h --> initial condition setup, including BEC tracers
- tracers.opt --> declares all bec tracer min/max values that are used in ana_int.h
			--> look for t_anamin, t_anamax (declared in tracers.F with ANA_BEC_INI CPP)
			--> a bit of a cumbersome way to do it now, but its easy to go trc by trc 

- water depth (HD[m]) is set in param.opt (for now) --> but there is a weird issue with h allocation in grid.F right now


Apart from that, 
edit param.opt in the usual way (cppdefs.opt should be untouched to keep this setup as is)

				INTERNAL UCLA NOTES

- analytical.F changed in this directory relative to repo as of sept. 2023
	--> had to follow what is in Filament example and remove istr,iend,jstr,jend from
	    ana_vmix calls and comment out exchange_tile calls (also deleted cubic profile code, which should
	    be removed from the repo /src/)

- grid.F 
    --> the compiler was complaining about setting h(i,j)=HD in ana_grid.h, so
	I just manually set h=HD in grid.F as a temporary work-around'
    --> there seems to be some Heisenbug allocation issue related to this and there is 
        a shameful hardcode workaround for now
